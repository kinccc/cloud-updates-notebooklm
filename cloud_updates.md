### AWS SAM CLI adds Finch support, expanding local development tool options for serverless applications

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/using-sam-cli.html" target="_blank">AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI)</a> now supports <a href="https://runfinch.com/" target="_blank">Finch</a> as an alternative to Docker for local development and testing of serverless applications. This gives developers greater flexibility in choosing their preferred local development environment when working with SAM CLI to build and test their serverless applications.<br /> <br /> Developers building serverless applications spend significant time in their local development environments. SAM CLI is a command-line tool for local development and testing of serverless applications. It allows you to build, test, debug, and package your serverless applications locally before deploying to AWS Cloud. To provide the local development and testing environment for your applications, SAM CLI uses a tool that can run containers on your local device. Previously, SAM CLI only supported Docker as the tool for running containers locally. Starting today, SAM CLI also supports Finch as a container development tool. Finch is an open-source tool, developed and supported by AWS, for local container development. This means you can now choose between Docker and Finch as your preferred container tool for local development when working with SAM CLI.<br /> <br /> You can use SAM CLI to invoke Lambda functions locally, test API endpoints, and debug your serverless applications with the same experience you would have in the AWS Cloud. With Finch support, SAM CLI now automatically detects and uses Finch as the container development tool when Docker is not available. You can also set Finch as your preferred container tool for SAM CLI. This new feature supports all core SAM CLI commands including sam build, sam local invoke, sam local start-api, and sam local start-lambda.<br /> <br /> To learn more about using SAM CLI with Finch, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-finch.html" target="_blank">SAM CLI developer guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second-generation AWS Outposts racks are now supported in the AWS Europe (Ireland) Region. Outposts racks extend AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises data center or colocation space for a truly consistent hybrid experience.<br /> <br /> Organizations from startups to enterprises and the public sector in and outside of Europe can now order their Outposts racks connected to this new supported region, optimizing for their latency and data residency needs. Outposts allows customers to run workloads that need low latency access to on-premises systems locally while connecting back to their home Region for application management. Customers can also use Outposts and AWS services to manage and process data that needs to remain on-premises to meet data residency requirements. This regional expansion provides additional flexibility in the AWS Regions that customers‚Äô Outposts can connect to.<br /> <br /> To learn more about second-generation Outposts racks, read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-second-generation-aws-outposts-racks-with-breakthrough-performance-and-scalability-on-premises/" target="_blank"><u>this blog post</u></a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/network-userguide/what-is-outposts.html" target="_blank"><u>user guide</u></a>.

This unified view helps you quickly identify and resolve conflicts or gaps between your backup strategy and actual configuration.</p> 
<p>Backup plan schedule preview is available in all AWS Regions where <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html">AWS Backup is available</a>. You can start using this feature automatically from the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/backup">AWS Backup console,</a> API, or CLI without any additional settings.
